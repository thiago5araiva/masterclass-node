Welcome to the Course!

Thank you four purchasing these course lectures. Here are a few things to note before you get started:



1. There is a black "continue" button beneath every slide and video. Click that button to navigate to the next part of the course. If a slide has a lot of content, you may need to scroll down to see all the content and/or to reach the "continue" button.



2. When you finish a lecture it will be marked as "complete" with a check-mark. Your completion certificate will be generated automatically once all the lectures are marked as "complete". Your completion certificate will display the first name and last name you entered during signup. If you would like a different name to appear on your certificate, please go edit your account settings now, before your certificate is issued. Certificates cannot be edited once they are issued.



3. To rewatch a lecture, use the menu on the left side of the screen to jump around. You can rewatch every lecture an unlimited number of times, even after you complete the course.



We hope you enjoy your course!
